## Development

### Building the pkgdown Site

When building the pkgdown documentation site with
[`pkgdown::build_site()`](https://pkgdown.r-lib.org/reference/build_site.html),
the function needs to download external JavaScript and CSS dependencies
from CDNs (Content Delivery Networks). If you’re working in a restricted
network environment, you’ll need to ensure access to the following CDNs:

- `https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/` - For headroom.js (sticky header
  functionality)
- `https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/` - For bootstrap-toc.js (table of contents)
  and other Bootstrap dependencies

Without access to these CDNs,
[`pkgdown::build_site()`](https://pkgdown.r-lib.org/reference/build_site.html)
will fail with errors like:

``` R
Error: cannot open URL 'https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/headroom/0.11.0/headroom.min.js'
```

These dependencies are automatically cached after the first download, so
subsequent builds will be faster and won’t require network access unless
the cache is cleared.
