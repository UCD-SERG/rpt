\description{
This is an example function that demonstrates basic functionality and
various ways to include mathematical notation in roxygen2 documentation.

\section{Mathematical Notation in roxygen2}{
\subsection{Using \verb{\eqn{}} for inline math (works in all formats)}{

The median is a measure of central tendency where \eqn{x_{0.5}} represents
the value that splits the data in half.
}

\subsection{Using \verb{\deqn{}} for display equations (works in all formats)}{

The sample median for odd \eqn{n} is defined as:
\deqn{m = x_{(n+1)/2}}
}

\subsection{Using \verb{$$} for display math (HTML/pkgdown only, requires roxygen2 >= 7.0.0)}{

For even sample sizes, the median is the average of the two middle values:
$$m = \frac{x_{(n/2)} + x_{(n/2+1)}}{2}$$
}

\subsection{Using \code{$} for inline math (HTML/pkgdown only, requires roxygen2 >= 7.0.0)}{

In general, the median minimizes $\sum_{i=1}^{n} |x_i - m|$.
