\usage{
math_demo(a, b, c)
}
\arguments{
\item{a}{Numeric coefficient of \eqn{x^2}{x^2}}

\item{b}{Numeric coefficient of \eqn{x}{x}}

\item{c}{Numeric constant term}
}
\value{
A numeric vector of length 1 or 2 containing the root(s) of
the equation. Complex roots are returned as complex numbers.
}
\description{
The quadratic formula is given by:
\deqn{x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}}{
  x = (-b ± sqrt(b^2 - 4ac)) / (2a)}

For inline math, the variance is denoted \eqn{\sigma^2}{sigma^2},
and the standard deviation is \eqn{\sigma}{sigma}.
}
\details{
This function demonstrates how to include formatted mathematical expressions
in roxygen2 documentation using LaTeX syntax.

This function computes the roots of a quadratic equation of the form:
\deqn{ax^2 + bx + c = 0}{ax^2 + bx + c = 0}

The discriminant is \eqn{\Delta = b^2 - 4ac}{Delta = b^2 - 4ac}.
When \eqn{\Delta > 0}{Delta > 0}, there are two real roots.
When \eqn{\Delta = 0}{Delta = 0}, there is one repeated real root.
When \eqn{\Delta < 0}{Delta < 0}, there are two complex conjugate roots.

Additional mathematical notation examples:
\itemize{
\item Sum notation: \eqn{\sum_{i=1}^{n} x_i}{sum(x_i, i=1..n)}
\item Integral: \eqn{\int_{0}^{\infty} e^{-x} dx = 1}{
    integral from 0 to infinity of e^(-x) dx = 1}
\item Matrix multiplication:
\eqn{\mathbf{Y} = \mathbf{X}\boldsymbol{\beta} +
    \boldsymbol{\epsilon}}{Y = X*beta + epsilon}
\item Greek letters: \eqn{\alpha, \beta, \gamma, \delta}{
    alpha, beta, gamma, delta}
}

\examples{
# Two real roots: x^2 - 5x + 6 = 0
# Solution: x = 2 or x = 3

# One repeated root: x^2 - 4x + 4 = 0
# Solution: x = 2
