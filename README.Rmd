## Installation

You can install the development version of `{rpt}` from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

## Development

### Building the Documentation Site

This package uses [altdoc](https://altdoc.etiennebacher.com/) with [docsify](https://docsify.js.org/) to build its documentation site. To build and preview the documentation locally:

```r
# Load the package
pkgload::load_all()

# Render the documentation

# Preview the site
altdoc::preview_docs()
```

The documentation is automatically built and deployed to GitHub Pages via GitHub Actions when changes are pushed to the main branch.
